# Cloud Infrastructure

## Objective

To design and implement a secure, scalable private cloud infrastructure that centralizes application hosting, optimizes resource management, and enhances data security and compliance through the integration of AWS and FileCloud technologies.

### Skills Learned

- Cloud Infrastructure Design
- Virtualization and Resource Optimization 
- Security and Compliance Implementation
- Network Configuration and Management

### Tools Used

- Amazon Web Services (AWS) – For building and managing the private cloud infrastructure, including virtual machines, networking, and load balancing.
- FileCloud – Used for secure file sharing, storage, and management within the private cloud environment.
- Virtual Machines (EC2 instances) – For hosting internal applications and services in an isolated, scalable environment.
- Load Balancers (AWS Elastic Load Balancing) – To distribute traffic efficiently across multiple compute resources.
- Network Configuration Tools (Subnets, Security Groups) – For setting up network segments, firewalls, and secure communication channels.
